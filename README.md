# dqcommwordcloud

This is the R code to generate the interactive word cloud on the [DQcomm2018 website](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/DQComm2018/).

The text to visualize was the titles of 1000 papers from a Google Scholar search of "media deliberation". On the wordcloud, the TD-IDF of each word is shown with font size.

The word cloud was generated with the [R wrapper of wordcloud2.js](https://github.com/chainsawriot/wordcloudrr).
