# dqcommwordcloud

The R code to generate the interactive word cloud on the [DQcomm2018 website](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/DQComm2018/).

The word cloud is based on the titles of 1000 papers from a Google Scholar of "media deliberation". The TD-IDF of each word is shown with font size.

The word cloud is generated with the [R wrapper of wordcloud2.js](https://github.com/chainsawriot/wordcloudrr).
